Description: Deployment Orchestrator of Puppet via MCollective
 For the provisionning, Astute orchestrator collects data about nodes and
 creates corresponding Cobbler systems using parameters specified in engine
 section of provision data. After the systems are created, it connects to
 Cobbler engine and reboots nodes according to the power management parameters
 of the node.
 .
 For the deployment, Astute uses data about nodes and recalculates needed
 parameters. Calculated parameters are passed to the nodes being deployed by
 using the nailyfact MCollective agent, that uploads these attributes to the
 /etc/astute.yaml file of the node. Then puppet parses this file using Facter
 plugin and uploads these facts into puppet. These facts are used during
 catalog compilation phase by puppet. Finally catalog is executed and Astute
 orchestrator passes to the next node in deployment sequence. Fuel Library
 provides puppet modules for Astute.

Description: Galois Field Arithmetic - development files
 Galois Field arithmetic forms the backbone of erasure-coded storage systems,
 most famously the Reed-Solomon erasure code. A Galois Field is defined over
 w-bit words and is termed GF(2w). As such, the elements of a Galois Field are
 the integers 0, 1, . . ., 2^w − 1. Galois Field arithmetic defines addition
 and multiplication over these closed sets of integers in such a way that they
 work as you would hope they would work. Specifically, every number has a
 unique multiplicative inverse. Moreover, there is a value, typically the value
 2, which has the property that you can enumerate all of the non-zero elements
 of the field by taking that value to successively higher powers.

 It is nice to build HTML using regular HTML tags, instead of building up DOM
 structures in script. However, there is no good way to embed HTML in a

 can be hard to manage, particularly for multi-line HTML.

Description: OpenStack virtual network service - Linux bridge agent
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
 .
 This package provides the Linux bridge agent. If you choose to use the Linux
 bridge plugin on neutron-server, this agent should run on each compute node.

Description: Jinja2 adapter for Django - Python 2.x
 Coffin is a Jinja2 adapter for Django. Coffin currently makes the following
 Django tags available in Jinja:
  * {% cache %} - has currently an incompatibility: The second argument (the
    fragment name) needs to be specified with surrounding quotes if it is
    supposed to be a literal string, according to Jinja2 syntax. It will
    otherwise be considered an identifer and resolved as a variable.
  * {% load %} - is actually a no-op in Coffin, since templatetag libraries are
    always loaded. See also "Custom Filters and extensions".
  * {% spaceless %}
  * {% url %} - additionally, a view|url() filter is also available. Or use
    view|url() for Django 1.5 style lookups by the value of view.
  * {% with %}
  * {% csrf_token %}
 .
 Django filters that are ported in Coffin:
  * date
  * floatformat
  * pluralize (expects an optional second parameter rather than the comma
    syntax)
  * time
  * timesince
  * timeuntil
  * truncatewords
  * truncatewords_html

Description: Jinja2 adapter for Django - doc
 Coffin is a Jinja2 adapter for Django. Coffin currently makes the following
 Django tags available in Jinja:
  * {% cache %} - has currently an incompatibility: The second argument (the
    fragment name) needs to be specified with surrounding quotes if it is
    supposed to be a literal string, according to Jinja2 syntax. It will
    otherwise be considered an identifer and resolved as a variable.
  * {% load %} - is actually a no-op in Coffin, since templatetag libraries are
    always loaded. See also "Custom Filters and extensions".
  * {% spaceless %}
  * {% url %} - additionally, a view|url() filter is also available. Or use
    view|url() for Django 1.5 style lookups by the value of view.
  * {% with %}
  * {% csrf_token %}
 .
 Django filters that are ported in Coffin:
  * date
  * floatformat
  * pluralize (expects an optional second parameter rather than the comma
    syntax)
  * time
  * timesince
  * timeuntil
  * truncatewords
  * truncatewords_html
 .

Description: makes it easier to use PySCSS in Django
 Django-pyscss is a collection of tools for making it easier to use pyScss
 within Django. It overwrites the import system to use Django's staticfiles
 app. This way you can import SCSS files from any app (or any file that's
 findable by the STATICFILES_FINDERS) with no hassle. It provides a
 django-compressor precompile filter class so that you can easily use pyScss
 with django-compressor without having to bust out to the shell. This has the
 added benefit of removing the need to configure pyScss through its
 command-line arguments AND makes it possible for the exceptions and warnings
 that pyScss emits to bubble up to your process so that you can actually know
 what's going on.

Description: caching front-end based on the Dogpile lock - Python 2.x
 A caching API built around the concept of a "dogpile lock", which allows
 continued access to an expiring data value while a single thread generates a
 new value.
 .
 dogpile.cache builds on the dogpile.core locking system
 (see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dogpile.core), which implements the idea of
 "allow one creator to write while others read" in the abstract. Overall,
 dogpile.cache is intended as a replacement to the Beaker (see
 http://beaker.groovie.org) caching system, the internals of which are written
 by the same author. All the ideas of Beaker which "work" are re-implemented in
 dogpile.cache in a more efficient and succinct manner, and all the cruft
 (Beaker's internals were first written in 2005) relegated to the trash heap.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

Description: supersonic micro-framework for building cloud APIs - Python 2.x
 Falcon is a high-performance Python framework for building cloud APIs. It
 encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible
 while remaining highly effective.
 .
 Unlike other Python web frameworks, Falcon won't bottleneck your API's
 performance under highly concurrent workloads. Many frameworks max out at
 serving simple "hello world" requests at a few thousand req/sec, while Falcon
 can easily serve many more on the same hardware.
 .
 Falcon isn't very opinionated. In other words, the framework leaves a lot of
 decisions and implementation details to you.
 .
 Features:
  * Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
  * Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response classes
  * Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
  * DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
  * Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks
  * 20% speed boost when Cython is available
  * Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3.3 support
 .

Description: Pythonic task execution - Python 2.x
 Invoke is a Python (2.6+ and 3.2+) task execution tool and library, drawing
 inspiration from various sources to arrive at a powerful and clean feature
 set.
 .
 Like Ruby's Rake tool and Invoke's own predecessor Fabric 1.x, it provides a
 clean, high level API for running shell commands and defining/organizing task
 functions from a tasks.py file.
 .
 From GNU Make, it inherits an emphasis on minimal boilerplate for common
 patterns and the ability to run multiple tasks in a single invocation.
 .
 Following the lead of most Unix CLI applications, it offers a traditional
 flag-based style of command-line parsing, deriving flag names and value types
 from task signatures.
 .
 Like many of its predecessors, it offers advanced features as well:
 namespacing, task aliasing, before/after hooks, parallel execution and more.
 .

Description: library to apply JSON patches - python 2.x transitional package
 Python-json-patch is a Python module (a library) to apply JSON Patches
 according to the IETF draft specification.
 .
 From the IETF site:
 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.
 .
 This package is a transitional package to python-jsonpatch.

Description: extended implementation of JSONPath for Python 2.x
 This library provides a robust and significantly extended implementation of
 JSONPath for Python. It is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
 .
 This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it is a full
 language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
 objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.
 .
 The JSONPath syntax supported by this library includes some additional
 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

Description: Database schema migration for SQLAlchemy
 Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, migrate provides a way to deal
 with database schema changes in SQLAlchemy projects.
 .
 SQLAlchemy-migrate is build on top of SQLAlchemy and provides a changeset
 and a versioning API for database schemas as well as a script utilizing
 these APIs. The database change sets are managed in a file based
 repository allowing upgrades and downgrades of database schema versions.
 The change sets may consist of Python code facilitating the changeset API
 or SQL scripts.
 .
 SQLAlchemy-migrate has support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Oracle
 databases. The support for Oracle is not as well tested as the support for
 the other database systems.

Description: decorator for parameterized testing with Nose - Python 2.x
 nose-parameterized is a decorator for parameterized testing with nose.
 .
 Nose. It's got test generators. But they kind of suck:
  * They often require a second function
  * They make it difficult to separate the data from the test
  * They don't work with subclases of unittest.TestCase
  * kwargs? What kwargs?
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.

Description: test configuration plugin for nosetests
 nose-testconfig is a plugin to the nose test framework which provides a
 faculty for passing test-specific (or test-run specific) configuration data to
 the tests being executed.
 .
 Currently configuration files in the following formats are supported:
   * YAML (via python-yaml)
   * INI (via ConfigParser)
   * Pure Python (via Exec)
   * JSON
 .
 The plugin is meant to be flexible, ergo the support of exec'ing arbitrary
 Python files as configuration files with no checks. The default format is
 assumed to be ConfigParser ini-style format.
 .
 The plugin provides a method of overriding certain parameters from the command
 line (assuming that the main "config" object is a dict) and can easily have
 additional parsers added to it.
 .
 A configuration file may not be provided. In this case, the config object is an
 emtpy dict. Any command line "overriding" parameters will be added to the dict.

Description: OpenStack client configuation library - Python 2.x
 Os-client-config is a library for collecting client configuration for using an
 OpenStack cloud in a consistent and comprehensive manner. It will find cloud
 config for as few as 1 cloud and as many as you want to put in a config file.
 It will read environment variables and config files, and it also contains some
 vendor specific default values so that you don't have to know extra info to
 use OpenStack
 .
 os-client-config honors all of the normal OS_* variables. It does not provide
 backwards compatibility to service-specific variables such as NOVA_USERNAME.
 .
 If you have environment variables and no config files, os-client-config will
 produce a cloud config object named "openstack" containing your values from
 the environment.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.

Description: OpenStack client configuation library - doc
 Os-client-config is a library for collecting client configuration for using an
 OpenStack cloud in a consistent and comprehensive manner. It will find cloud
 config for as few as 1 cloud and as many as you want to put in a config file.
 It will read environment variables and config files, and it also contains some
 vendor specific default values so that you don't have to know extra info to
 use OpenStack
 .
 os-client-config honors all of the normal OS_* variables. It does not provide
 backwards compatibility to service-specific variables such as NOVA_USERNAME.
 .
 If you have environment variables and no config files, os-client-config will
 produce a cloud config object named "openstack" containing your values from
 the environment.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.

Description: OpenStack Profiler Library - Python 2.x
 OpenStack consists of multiple projects. Each project, in turn, is composed of
 multiple services. To process some request, e.g. to boot a virtual machine,
 OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In the case somethin
 works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes
 wrong and to locate the bottleneck.
 .
 To resolve this issue, a tiny but powerful library, osprofiler, has been
 interoduced, and can be used by all OpenStack projects and their Python

 involved services, and builds a tree of calls (see an example

Description: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 2.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of `d2to1` to provide for declarative configuration. It then
 filters the `setup.cfg` data through a setup hook to fill in default values
 and provide more sensible behaviors.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 2.x.

Description: extends Nose with certain TestNG like features - python 2.x
 Proboscis is a Python test framework that extends Python's built-in unittest
 module and Nose with features from TestNG.
 .
 TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing
 some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use.
 .
 Features:
  * Uses decorators instead of naming conventions.
  * Allows for TestNG style test methods, in which a class is initialized once,
    as an alternative to using class fields.
  * Allows for explicit test dependencies and skipping of dependent tests on
    failures.
  * Runs xUnit style clases if desired or needed for backwards compatibility.
  * Uses Nose if available (but doesn't require it), and works with many of
    its plugins.
  * Runs in IronPython and Jython (although if you're targeting the JVM you
    should consider using TestNG instead).
 .

Description: interface for implementing erasure codes - Python 2.x
 This library provides a simple Python interface for implementing erasure
 codes. To obtain the best possible performance, the underlying erasure code
 algorithms are written in C.
 .
 This library makes use of Jerasure for Reed-Solomon and provides its own flat
 XOR-based erasure code encoder and decoder. Currently, it implements a
 specific class of HD Combination Codes (see "Flat XOR-based erasure codes in
 storage systems: Constructions, efficient recovery, and tradeoffs" in IEEE
 MSST 2010). These codes are well-suited to archival use-cases, have a simple
 construction and require a minimum number of participating disks during
 single-disk reconstruction (think XOR-based LRC code).

Description: SAML Version 2 to be used in a WSGI environment - Python 2.x
 This package provides a Python implementation of SAML Version 2 to be used in
 a WSGI environment.
 .
 From wikipedia: Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) is a version
 of the SAML standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data
 between security domains. SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security
 tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal (usually an
 end user) between a SAML authority, that is, an identity provider, and a SAML
 consumer, that is, a service provider. SAML 2.0 enables web-based
 authentication and authorization scenarios including cross-domain single
 sign-on (SSO), which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing
 multiple authentication tokens to the user.

Description: documenting APIs built with Pecan and WSME
 sphinxcontrib.pecanwsme is an extension to Sphinx for documenting APIs built
 with Pecan and WSME.
 .
 The Pecan Python module is a WSGI object-dispatching web framework designed to
 be lean and fast with few dependencies. Pecan comes bundled with a lightweight
 WSGI development server based on Python's wsgiref.simpleserver. Pecan
 applications also come with an interactive Python shell which can be used to
 execute expressions in an environment very similar to the one your application
 runs in (using the "pecan shell" command).
 .
 WSGI is the "Web Server Gateway Interface". It defines a simple and universal
 interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the
 Python programming language.
 .
 Web Service Made Easy (WSME) simplify the writing of REST web services by
 providing simple yet powerful typing which removes the need to directly
 manipulate the request and the response objects.

Description: manage dynamic plugins for Python applications - python2
 Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and
 extend your application by discovering and loading extensions (plugins) at
 runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using
 __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
 mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing
 entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager
 classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded
 extensions.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

Description: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Description: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - Python 2.x
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.

Description: installs a WSGI application in place of a real URI for testing
 Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host
 and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library
 lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect
 them into a WSGI application importable by your test program. Thus, you can
 avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.
 .
 wsgi_intercept works by replacing httplib.HTTPConnection with a subclass,
 wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection. This class then redirects specific
 server/port combinations into a WSGI application by emulating a socket. If no
 intercept is registered for the host and port requested, those requests are
 passed on to the standard handler.

Description: Web Services Made Easy: implement multi-protocol webservices - Python 2.x
 Web Service Made Easy (WSME) simplify the writing of REST web services by
 providing simple yet powerful typing which removes the need to directly
 manipulate the request and the response objects.
 .
 WSME can work standalone or on top of your favorite Python web (micro)
 framework, so you can use both your preferred way of routing your REST requests
 and most of the features of WSME that rely on the typing system like:
 .
  * Alternate protocols, including ones supporting batch-calls
  * Easy documentation through a Sphinx extension
 .
 WSME is originally a rewrite of TGWebServices with focus on extensibility,
 framework-independance and better type handling.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

Description: XStatic base package with minimal support code - Python 2.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

Description: Yet Another Query Language - Python 2.x
 At the beginning of millennium the growing trend towards data formats
 standardization and application integrability made XML extremely popular. XML
 became lingua franca of the data. Applications tended to process lots of XML
 files ranging from small config files to very large datasets. As these data
 often had a complex structure with many levels of nestedness it is quickly
 became obvious that there is a need for specially crafted domain specific
 languages to query these data sets. This is how XPath and later XQL were born.
 .
 With later popularization of REST services and Web 2.0 JSON started to take
 XML’s place. JSON’s main advantage (besides being simpler than XML) is that is
 closely reassembles data structures found in most programming languages
 (arrays, dictionaries, scalars) making it very convenient for data
 serialization. As JSON lacked all the brilliant XML-related technologies like
 XSLT, XML Schema, XPath etc. various attempts to develop similar languages for
 JSON were made. One of those efforts was JSONPath library developed in 2007 by
 Stefan Gössner. Initial implementation was for PHP and JavaScript languages,
 but later on ports to other languages including Python were written. YAQL is
 one of the implementations in Python.

Description: provides a set of testing utilities for the kazoo library - Python 2.x
 Zake is a Python package that works to provide a nice set of testing utilities
 for the kazoo library.
 .
 It includes the following functionality:
  * Storage access (for viewing what was saved/created).
  * Kazoo *mostly* compatible client API.
  * Sync/transaction/create/get/delete... commands.
  * Listener support.
  * And more...
 .
 It simplifies testing by providing a client that has a similar API as the
 kazoo client so that your tests (or applications/libraries that use kazoo) do
 not require a real zookeeper server to be  tested with (since this is not
 available in all testing environments).
 .

 Django tags available in Jinja:
  * {% cache %} - has currently an incompatibility: The second argument (the
    fragment name) needs to be specified with surrounding quotes if it is
    supposed to be a literal string, according to Jinja2 syntax. It will
    otherwise be considered an identifer and resolved as a variable.
  * {% load %} - is actually a no-op in Coffin, since templatetag libraries are
    always loaded. See also "Custom Filters and extensions".
  * {% spaceless %}
  * {% url %} - additionally, a view|url() filter is also available. Or use
    view|url() for Django 1.5 style lookups by the value of view.
  * {% with %}
  * {% csrf_token %}
 .
 Django filters that are ported in Coffin:
  * date
  * floatformat
  * pluralize (expects an optional second parameter rather than the comma
    syntax)
  * time
  * timesince
  * timeuntil
  * truncatewords
  * truncatewords_html

Description: caching front-end based on the Dogpile lock - Python 3.x
 A caching API built around the concept of a "dogpile lock", which allows
 continued access to an expiring data value while a single thread generates a
 new value.
 .
 dogpile.cache builds on the dogpile.core locking system
 (see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dogpile.core), which implements the idea of
 "allow one creator to write while others read" in the abstract. Overall,
 dogpile.cache is intended as a replacement to the Beaker (see
 http://beaker.groovie.org) caching system, the internals of which are written
 by the same author. All the ideas of Beaker which "work" are re-implemented in
 dogpile.cache in a more efficient and succinct manner, and all the cruft
 (Beaker's internals were first written in 2005) relegated to the trash heap.

Description: supersonic micro-framework for building cloud APIs - Python 3.x
 Falcon is a high-performance Python framework for building cloud APIs. It
 encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible
 while remaining highly effective.
 .
 Unlike other Python web frameworks, Falcon won't bottleneck your API's
 performance under highly concurrent workloads. Many frameworks max out at
 serving simple "hello world" requests at a few thousand req/sec, while Falcon
 can easily serve many more on the same hardware.
 .
 Falcon isn't very opinionated. In other words, the framework leaves a lot of
 decisions and implementation details to you.
 .
 Features:
  * Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
  * Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response classes
  * Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
  * DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
  * Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks
  * 20% speed boost when Cython is available
  * Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3.3 support

Description: Pythonic task execution - Python 3.x
 Invoke is a Python (2.6+ and 3.2+) task execution tool and library, drawing
 inspiration from various sources to arrive at a powerful and clean feature
 set.
 .
 Like Ruby's Rake tool and Invoke's own predecessor Fabric 1.x, it provides a
 clean, high level API for running shell commands and defining/organizing task
 functions from a tasks.py file.
 .
 From GNU Make, it inherits an emphasis on minimal boilerplate for common
 patterns and the ability to run multiple tasks in a single invocation.
 .
 Following the lead of most Unix CLI applications, it offers a traditional
 flag-based style of command-line parsing, deriving flag names and value types
 from task signatures.
 .
 Like many of its predecessors, it offers advanced features as well:
 namespacing, task aliasing, before/after hooks, parallel execution and more.
 .

Description: library to apply JSON patches - python 3.x transitional package
 Python-json-patch is a Python module (a library) to apply JSON Patches
 according to the IETF draft specification.
 .
 From the IETF site:
 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.
 .
 This package is a transitional package to python3-jsonpatch.

Description: extended implementation of JSONPath for Python 3.x
 This library provides a robust and significantly extended implementation of
 JSONPath for Python. It is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
 .
 This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it is a full
 language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
 objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.
 .
 The JSONPath syntax supported by this library includes some additional
 features and omits some problematic features (those that make it unportable).
 In particular, some new operators such as "|" and "where" are available, and
 parentheses are used for grouping not for callbacks into Python, since with
 these changes the language is not trivially associative. Also, fields may be
 quoted whether or not they are contained in brackets.
 .

 config for as few as 1 cloud and as many as you want to put in a config file.
 It will read environment variables and config files, and it also contains some
 vendor specific default values so that you don't have to know extra info to
 use OpenStack
 .
 os-client-config honors all of the normal OS_* variables. It does not provide
 backwards compatibility to service-specific variables such as NOVA_USERNAME.
 .
 If you have environment variables and no config files, os-client-config will
 produce a cloud config object named "openstack" containing your values from
 the environment.

Description: OpenStack Profiler Library - Python 3.x
 OpenStack consists of multiple projects. Each project, in turn, is composed of
 multiple services. To process some request, e.g. to boot a virtual machine,
 OpenStack uses multiple services from different projects. In the case somethin
 works too slowly, it's extremely complicated to understand what exactly goes
 wrong and to locate the bottleneck.
 .
 To resolve this issue, a tiny but powerful library, osprofiler, has been
 interoduced, and can be used by all OpenStack projects and their Python
 clients. To be able to generate one trace per request, that goes through all
 involved services, and builds a tree of calls (see an example
 http://pavlovic.me/rally/profiler/).

Description: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 3.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of `d2to1` to provide for declarative configuration. It then
 filters the `setup.cfg` data through a setup hook to fill in default values
 and provide more sensible behaviors.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 3.x.

Description: extends Nose with certain TestNG like features - python 3.x
 Proboscis is a Python test framework that extends Python's built-in unittest
 module and Nose with features from TestNG.
 .
 TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing
 some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use.
 .
 Features:
  * Uses decorators instead of naming conventions.
  * Allows for TestNG style test methods, in which a class is initialized once,
    as an alternative to using class fields.
  * Allows for explicit test dependencies and skipping of dependent tests on
    failures.
  * Runs xUnit style clases if desired or needed for backwards compatibility.
  * Uses Nose if available (but doesn't require it), and works with many of
    its plugins.
  * Runs in IronPython and Jython (although if you're targeting the JVM you
    should consider using TestNG instead).
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.

Description: interface for implementing erasure codes - Python 3.x
 This library provides a simple Python interface for implementing erasure
 codes. To obtain the best possible performance, the underlying erasure code
 algorithms are written in C.
 .
 This library makes use of Jerasure for Reed-Solomon and provides its own flat
 XOR-based erasure code encoder and decoder. Currently, it implements a
 specific class of HD Combination Codes (see "Flat XOR-based erasure codes in
 storage systems: Constructions, efficient recovery, and tradeoffs" in IEEE
 MSST 2010). These codes are well-suited to archival use-cases, have a simple
 construction and require a minimum number of participating disks during
 single-disk reconstruction (think XOR-based LRC code).
 .

 __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
 mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing
 entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager
 classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded
 extensions.

Description: utility belt for automated testing - Python 3.x
 Sure is a library for Python that leverages a DSL for writing assertions. In
 CPython it monkey-patches the object type, adding some methods and properties
 purely for test purposes. Any Python code writen after "import sure" gains
 testing superpowers.

Description: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - Python 3.x
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.
 .

Description: installs a WSGI application in place of a real URI for testing (python3)
 Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host
 and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library
 lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect
 them into a WSGI application importable by your test program. Thus, you can
 avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.
 .
 wsgi_intercept works by replacing httplib.HTTPConnection with a subclass,
 wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection. This class then redirects specific
 server/port combinations into a WSGI application by emulating a socket. If no
 intercept is registered for the host and port requested, those requests are
 passed on to the standard handler.

Description: Web Services Made Easy: implement multi-protocol webservices - Python 3.x
 Web Service Made Easy (WSME) simplify the writing of REST web services by
 providing simple yet powerful typing which removes the need to directly
 manipulate the request and the response objects.
 .
 WSME can work standalone or on top of your favorite Python web (micro)
 framework, so you can use both your preferred way of routing your REST requests
 and most of the features of WSME that rely on the typing system like:
 .
  * Alternate protocols, including ones supporting batch-calls
  * Easy documentation through a Sphinx extension
 .
 WSME is originally a rewrite of TGWebServices with focus on extensibility,
 framework-independance and better type handling.

Description: XStatic base package with minimal support code - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

Description: Angular JS Mock XStatic support - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework
 or other stuff you don't want. Maybe there will be optional XStatic extensions
 for all sorts of stuff, but they won't be required if you just want the files.
 .
 By having static files in packages, it is also easier to build virtual envs,
 support linux/bsd/... distribution package maintainers and even windows
 installs using the same mechanism.

Description: JQuery Tablesorter XStatic support - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a packaging standard to package external (often 3rd party) static
 files as a Python package, so they are easily usable on all operating systems,
 with any package management system or even without one.
 .
 Many Python projects need to use some specific data files, like javascript,
 css, java applets, images, etc. Sometimes these files belong to YOUR project
 (then you may want to package them separately, but you could also just put
 them into your main package). But in many other cases, those files are
 maintained by someone else (like jQuery javascript library or even much bigger
 js libraries or applications) and you definitely do not really want to merge
 them into your project. So, you want to have static file packages, but you
 don’t want to get lots of stuff you do not want. Thus, stuff required by
 XStatic file packages (especially the main, toplevel XStatic package) tries to
 obey to be a MINIMAL, no-fat thing. XStatic doesn't "sell" any web framework

Description: Yet Another Query Language - Python 3.x
 At the beginning of millennium the growing trend towards data formats
 standardization and application integrability made XML extremely popular. XML
 became lingua franca of the data. Applications tended to process lots of XML
 files ranging from small config files to very large datasets. As these data
 often had a complex structure with many levels of nestedness it is quickly
 became obvious that there is a need for specially crafted domain specific
 languages to query these data sets. This is how XPath and later XQL were born.
 .
 With later popularization of REST services and Web 2.0 JSON started to take
 XML’s place. JSON’s main advantage (besides being simpler than XML) is that is
 closely reassembles data structures found in most programming languages
 (arrays, dictionaries, scalars) making it very convenient for data
 serialization. As JSON lacked all the brilliant XML-related technologies like
 XSLT, XML Schema, XPath etc. various attempts to develop similar languages for
 JSON were made. One of those efforts was JSONPath library developed in 2007 by
 Stefan Gössner. Initial implementation was for PHP and JavaScript languages,
 but later on ports to other languages including Python were written. YAQL is
 one of the implementations in Python.

Description: provides a set of testing utilities for the kazoo library - Python 3.x
 Zake is a Python package that works to provide a nice set of testing utilities
 for the kazoo library.
 .
 It includes the following functionality:
  * Storage access (for viewing what was saved/created).
  * Kazoo *mostly* compatible client API.
  * Sync/transaction/create/get/delete... commands.
  * Listener support.
  * And more...
 .
 It simplifies testing by providing a client that has a similar API as the
 kazoo client so that your tests (or applications/libraries that use kazoo) do
 not require a real zookeeper server to be  tested with (since this is not
 available in all testing environments).
 .

Description: partial wrapper around the SIOCETHTOOL ioctl
 Have you ever needed to get at some details about a network interface from
 inside a Ruby script, but got stuck trying to parse the output of ethtool? If
 so, you're one-in-a-million, but at least you don't have to write an ethtool
 parser any more. use Rethtool instead!
 .
 At present, Rethtool only supports a couple of things:
  * Retrieve various details about the interface (link speed, duplex, etc).
  * Determine if the link is currently up or down.
 .
 Adding extra SIOCETHTOOL features is relatively straightforward, thanks to
 cstruct and the base infrastructure already in place.

Description: symbols-only hash for Ruby
 SymbolTable is a handy little Ruby class that was conceived from the union of
 Hash and Symbol. SymbolTable directly extends Hash, but it stores all keys
 internally as symbols. Any key that cannot be converted to a Symbol is not
 valid.
 .
 While this may seem restrictive, it does have the nice side effect of making
 all keys slightly more memorable and usable. For example, values may be set
 and retrieved using any key that resolves to the same symbol.

Description: SFTP interface to Rackspace/OpenStack storage services
 This package provides an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) interface to
 Rackspace Cloud Files and OpenStack Object Storage, acting as a proxy between
 an SFTP client and a remote storage service.
 .
 The username/password pair used to open the SFTP session is validated using the
 authentication service of the storage service to get an authentication
 token.
 .
 The communication between the client and the SFTP daemon is encrypted all the
 time, and the SFTP service supports HTTPS communication with the remote
 storage service.

Description: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.

Description: Database as a Service for OpenStack - API server
 Trove is Database as a Service for Openstack. It's designed to run entirely on
 OpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and easily utilize the
 features of a relational database without the burden of handling complex
 administrative tasks. Cloud users and database administrators can provision
 and manage multiple database instances as needed. Initially, the service will
 focus on providing resource isolation at high performance while automating
 complex administrative tasks including deployment, configuration, patching,
 backups, restores, and monitoring. Trove is designed to support a
 single-tenant database within a Nova instance. There is no restrictions on how
 Nova is configured, since Trove interacts with other OpenStack components
 purely through the API.
 .
 This package provides the Trove API server. The trove-api service provides a
 RESTful API that supports JSON and XML to provision and manage Trove
 instances.

Description: Database as a Service for OpenStack - doc
 Trove is Database as a Service for Openstack. It's designed to run entirely on
 OpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and easily utilize the
 features of a relational database without the burden of handling complex
 administrative tasks. Cloud users and database administrators can provision
 and manage multiple database instances as needed. Initially, the service will
 focus on providing resource isolation at high performance while automating
 complex administrative tasks including deployment, configuration, patching,
 backups, restores, and monitoring. Trove is designed to support a
 single-tenant database within a Nova instance. There is no restrictions on how
 Nova is configured, since Trove interacts with other OpenStack components
 purely through the API.
 .
 This package provides the Trove documentations.

Description: control how and where OpenStack services are deployed - meta package
 Tuskar gives administrators the ability to control how and where OpenStack
 services are deployed across the datacenter. Using Tuskar, administrators
 divide hardware into "resource classes" that allow predictable elastic scaling
 as cloud demands grow. This resource orchestration allows Tuskar users to
 ensure SLAs, improve performance, and maximize utilization across the
 datacenter.
 .
 Tuskar services are available via a RESTful API and management console through
 which administrators are able to classify their hardware and define their
 datacenters. In addition, Tuskar components provide administrators with
 performance monitoring, health statistics, and usage metrics, aiding in
 capacity planning and hardware procurement decisions.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that helps installing all of Tuskar at once.

Description: WebSockets support for any application/server
 websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the noVNC project.
 .
 At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic to
 normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake, parses it,
 and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and the target in both
 directions.
 .
 Websockify supports all versions of the WebSockets protocol (Hixie and HyBi).
 The older Hixie versions of the protocol only support UTF-8 text payloads. In
 order to transport binary data over UTF-8 an encoding must used to encapsulate
 the data within UTF-8.
 .
 With Hixie clients, Websockify uses base64 to encode all traffic to and from
 the client. This does not affect the data between websockify and the server.
 .
 With HyBi clients, websockify negotiates whether to base64 encode traffic to
 and from the client via the subprotocol header (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol). The
 valid subprotocol values are 'binary' and 'base64' and if the client sends
 both then the server (the Python implementation) will prefer 'binary'. The
 'binary' subprotocol indicates that the data will be sent raw using binary
 WebSocket frames. Some HyBi clients (such as the Flash fallback and older
 Chrome and iOS versions) do not support binary data which is why the
 negotiation is necessary.
